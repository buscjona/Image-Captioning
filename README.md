# Our machine learning project
Hello, we are Jonas, Moritz and Ole. Together we have set ourselves the goal of building, explaining and presenting an image caption generator using Deep Learning and its Neural Networks. We use this subtype of machine learning as it is the closest to the way humans analyze images. Based on this, we want to compare our own generated 
caption with the actual caption of the image. The user can then vote which of the captions is more accurate. All results are displayed by means of a chart for evaluation.
