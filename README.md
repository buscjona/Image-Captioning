# Our machine learning project
Hello, we are Jonas, Moritz and Ole. Together we have set ourselves the goal of building, explaining and presenting an image caption generator using Deep Learning and its Neural Networks. We use this subtype of machine learning as it is the closest to the way humans analyze images. The user has the option to upload any image to which our model will generate a caption as accurate as possible. After that, the user can vote whether the original or generated caption better reflects the image content. All results are displayed by means of a chart for further evaluation.
